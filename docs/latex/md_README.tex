Perception is essential for object detection, environmental awareness, path planning and control; through perception, a system can truly be considered autonomous. Acme requires the development of a perception component in its autonomous car system, and a human obstacle detection and tracking module needs to be built. The aim is to build a perception module to detect human objects and track their location directly into the robot reference frame. The location will first be found with respect to the camera\textquotesingle{}s reference frame and then using a transformation, the location with respect to the robot reference frame will be found. The module is built such that, the system that implements it will consists of a camera mounted on a car that will keep track of human motion within the cameraâ€™s field of view. But the module will be unable to handle occlusion cases.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Assumption}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
The camera used for perception will be placed on the top of the car. The camera reference frame is taken such that the z-\/axis is pointing out of the lens, the x-\/axis is to the right, and the y-\/axis is pointing downward. The robot reference frame is at the centre of mass where the z-\/axis points upward, and the x-\/axis is to the right, and the y-\/axis points straight ahead. We assume the camera is monocular, and the user must input most of the configuration information\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Features}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}

The module uses a monocular camera and is unable to handle occlusions. Also, the monocular camera cannot perform precise depth calculation and thus would require a deep learning model for accurate estimation. The runtime fps and memory management depend on the physical constraints of the system.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Personnel}\label{md_README_autotoc_md5}

The project development will be executed using pair programming concepts. For all specific tasks, driver and navigator roles will be swapped. The project will follow AIP concepts and be performed using Pair Programming. The module works such that a video is fed into the system using the monocular camera. The program then converts the video stream into image frames and performs human obstacle detection. Once obstacles are found in the image frame, unique IDs are assigned to the objects, which will hold the calculated current location with respect to the robot reference frame. The process is repeated over time for tracking of obstacle movement. Testing of components is performed using Google\+Test, and system testing will be performed every iteration for overall functionality verification.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsection{Standard install via command-\/line}\label{md_README_autotoc_md8}
